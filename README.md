# Data Sets
This is a public repository to store the collection of data sets I use in my work.
All of the data sets in this repository are listed below and stored in the data folder. Documentation, when available, is saved in the documentation folder.

## Using Data
You are welcome to download and use data however you'd like. If you'd prefer for your code to connect directly to a url, navigate to the file and view the data in its raw format. You can then use that url to paste into your code. See screenshot below of how to view in raw and an example R script that will scrape the file.
